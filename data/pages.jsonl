Real GDP growth is projected to improve gradually to 2 percent in \n2024–25 supported by public investment, spillovers from the ongoing LNG expansion project, \nand strong tourism. Medium-term growth is expected to accelerate to 4¾ percent on average, \nboosted by the significant LNG production expansion and initial gains from implementing \nreforms guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). Headline inflation will \nlikely ease to 1 percent in 2024 and converge to around 2 percent over the medium term.  \nWith lower hydrocarbon prices, both the current account and fiscal surpluses narrowed in \n2023, to 17 percent of GDP and 5½ percent of GDP, respectively. The twin surpluses \nmoderated further in 2024. Over the medium, as Qatar’s LNG production expands massively, \nboth the current and fiscal accounts will likely remain in surpluses, albeit declining as a share \nof GDP, as hydrocarbon prices are projected to fall. \nBanks are well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable, with the capital adequacy ratio of close to \n20 percent and return on equity of 14½ percent, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024. \nSince the implementation of QCB measures to reduce banks’ net short-term foreign liabilities, \nbanks’ non-resident deposits declined significantly, and banks have lengthened the average \nmaturity and diversified further the sources of foreign funding. The sector-wide NPL ratio \nremained broadly unchanged at slightly below 4 percent and the provisioning coverage ratio is \nrelatively high at above 80 percent.     \nQatar has started to implement the ambitious Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) to \nbuild a more diversified, knowledge-based and private sector-driven economy.

Qatar is well positioned to leverage digitalization and AI for \nproductivity gains, and the nation’s climate agenda is advancing.  \nRisks to the outlook are broadly balanced.

Fiscal and external surpluses softened mainly due to \nlower hydrocarbon prices. Banks are healthy but pockets of vulnerabilities remain. Reform \nmomentum has strengthened, guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). \nOutlook and risks: Near-term growth is expected to strengthen gradually. The medium-\nterm outlook is more favorable, bolstered by massive LNG production expansion and \nreform gains. Fiscal and external surpluses will likely remain but moderate. Qatar has so far \nbeen resilient to the regional conflict, with risks to the outlook being balanced overall. \nQatar’s strong policy buffers can help mitigate the impact of adverse shocks. \nFiscal policy: The authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal prudence is welcome. The \npositive outlook provides an opportunity to accelerate revenue diversification including to \nintroduce a value-added tax and broaden the corporate income tax, enhance spending \nefficiency and gradually align domestic energy prices with export prices, and reorient \nspending to enable private sector-driven growth. Adopting a full-fledged medium-term \nfiscal framework, anchored by the benchmark to ensure intergenerational equity, will \nenhance fiscal sustainability while securing priority spending. Greater fiscal transparency \nand risk management, including on Public-Private Partnerships, will support the strategy.  \nMonetary and financial sector policies: The currency peg continues to serve the country \nwell. Efforts to strengthen liquidity management are welcome and should be guided by the \nrecent IMF technical assistance. Continued diligence to safeguard financial stability and \nformalizing the financial safety net are critical. Promoting more stable domestic funding \nthrough market deepening initiatives would help reduce banks’ exposure to short-term \nforeign funding. Strong efforts to improve AML/CFT effectiveness should continue. \nStructural reforms: Successful NDS3 implementation requires proper reform prioritization \nand inter-agency coordination. Priorities include to enhance human capital and innovation, \npromote trade diversification and FDI (with domestic knowledge spillovers) and further \nimprove business efficiency, especially access to finance. Qatar is well positioned to \nleverage digitalization and AI for productivity gains. Accelerating climate actions can \nstrengthen sustainability and generate “green” growth.

The authorities plan to resume gradual fiscal consolidation from 2024. Despite a \nmoderate fiscal loosening in 2023 amid slower growth, the NHPB is estimated to remain consistent \nwith the level suggested by the Permanent \nIncome Hypothesis (PIH), a benchmark to \nensure intergenerational equity (Text \nFigure 9). 4 The 2024 budget envisages \nspending cuts worth 2 ppts of GDP from \nthe 2023 outturn, mostly in capital \nexpenditure, while the fiscal outturn up to \nthe third quarter of 2024 suggests that the \noverall expenditure cuts could be milder \nthan budgeted, closer to 1½ ppts pf GDP. \nNonetheless, the fiscal stance is still likely \nto tighten, with the NHPB projected to \nimprove by around ¾ ppt of non-\nhydrocarbon GDP. The 2025 budget \nenvisages broadly prudent spending plans \namid the growth rebound. The medium-\nterm budget has been updated to reflect \nNDS3 spending needs, where continued \ngradual consolidation is expected.  \n14.      Staff welcomed the authorities’ \ncommitment to continued fiscal \nprudence and recommended adopting a \nfiscal anchor to support the strategy. \nThe PIH-based benchmark can serve as a \nmedium-term fiscal anchor to ensure intergenerational equity. Higher-than-expected hydrocarbon \nrevenues should be saved to strengthen fiscal buffers. During economic downturns, some fiscal \nspace could be deployed to provide targeted support, while a credible plan should be in place to \nguide the NHPB to return to the PIH-based fiscal anchor (with a view to eventually introducing a \nfiscal rule). 5 The assessment of fiscal stance would be more accurate if expenditures by government \nrelated entities (GREs) are also accounted for. The PIH-based fiscal anchor should be updated \nperiodically as the global energy transition unfolds to ensure realistic long-term oil price \nassumptions. \n15.

To further reduce the \nprice differentials, the caps on diesel and gasoline prices should be lifted and remaining electricity \nsubsidies gradually phased out. The natural gas price differential (IEA, 2022) partially reflects the \nsupply-demand dynamics in domestic and international markets. 8 The first step is to improve \ntransparency of domestic gas pricing to better understand its disparity with Qatar’s export prices. \nLiquefication and export facilities could be expanded alongside the North Field LNG expansion to \nallow export of extra domestic gas supply to generate additional revenue and support Qatar’s \nclimate initiatives to ensure efficient natural gas use domestically. Gradually aligning domestic \nnatural gas prices with export ones would also incentivize the private sector to build comparative \nadvantages beyond low energy cost, fostering diversification that is not reliant on the hydrocarbon \nsector. \n", 4, 0], [73.42752075195312, 334.2613830566406, 533.4126586914062, 367.51483154296875, "17.

Results from cross-GCC panel \nregression suggest that for the GCC, the average long-run fiscal multiplier for capital expenditure (0.7) is \nstronger and more persistent than that for current expenditure (statistically insignificant), although the \ngrowth gains from the former emerge with a lag.

Using a single-county \napproach, time-varying fiscal multipliers from capital spending in Qatar are estimated on a 12-year rolling \nbasis.

Initiatives to \nfoster more stable domestic funding would complement the QCB measures in reducing banks’ \nreliance on short-term foreign funding. To help intensify reform implementation in adherence to \nFSS3, the QCB launched own Strategy 2024–30 in October 2024. Key stakeholders, including \ndifferent regulatory authorities, should coordinate to ensure policy consistency and timely \nimplementation.  \n23.\nQatar has made excellent progress in fighting financial crimes, and strong efforts\nshould continue. The 2023 AML/CFT mutual evaluation report by FATF acknowledges Qatar’s\nstrength in preventing financial crimes and law enforcement through improved risk assessment\ncapacity and clearer policy priorities. Measures to reduce risks associated with the use of a large\namount of cash are complemented by efforts to enhance financial inclusion through digitalization.\nThe QCB has banned financial institutions to use crypto assets. A beneficial ownership registry is\nbeing operationalized. Going forward, Qatar should strengthen risk-based supervision of non-\nfinancial businesses and professions, ensure that the beneficial ownership information is accurate\nand easily accessible, and improve further the capacity of AML/CFT law enforcement agencies.\nAuthorities’ Views \n24.\nThe authorities concurred with staff’s recommendation to continue exercising\nvigilance. The QCB highlighted that the newly introduced risk-based supervision strengthened\nassessment of emerging risks and early action. They believed that banks were well prepared to\nmanage legacy real estate sector weaknesses and the recent macroprudential measures were\neffectively implemented to address potential risks. The QCB also highlighted banks’ progress in\nlengthening the average maturity of foreign liabilities including via issuance of medium-term notes,\nand its commitment to regular risk reassessment. More broadly, the QCB stressed that both the\nmicro and macroprudential measures, including the counter-cyclical capital buffer, were periodically\nreviewed and would be dynamically adjusted to manage emerging risks. The authorities supported\nstaff’s call for deepening domestic capital markets, highlighting ongoing efforts in this area as part\nof the FSS3 implementation, including an initiative with the Ministry of Finance to build the domestic\nyield curve.\nC.\nMonetary Policy: Further Enhance Effectiveness of the Operational\nFramework\n25.\nThe exchange rate peg continues to serve Qatar well. The peg remains a credible\nmonetary anchor, backed by ample external buffers, continued fiscal prudence and competitiveness-\nenhancing reforms. In line with the exchange rate peg, Qatar’s monetary policy is broadly aligned\nwith that of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

They emphasized the ongoing effort to build\ncapacity and planned to progressively implement TA recommendations. The QCB noted that the\nrecent policy interest rate cuts, slightly more than the US Federal Reserve’s, were motivated by a\nrelatively wide interest rate differential to the Fed funds rate, domestic macroeconomic conditions\n(growth normalization and low inflation), and excess liquidity in the financial system. They\nhighlighted that the recent policy moves did not have any negative effects including on capital\nflows, and future policy decisions would be data driven. The QCB acknowledged the need to further\nimprove the effectiveness of monetary policy operational framework but saw it as a medium-term\nobjective. They agreed on the importance of communication and highlighted continued efforts to\nenhance it.\nD.\nStructural Reforms: Build a Knowledge-Based and Sustainable Economy\n28.\nQatar’s vision to build a diversified, knowledge-based economy requires enhanced\nhuman capital and output complexity (Text Figures 15 and 16). Staff analysis shows that human\ncapital is not only a large, direct contributor to per-capita output, but also an amplifier of the\ngrowth-enhancing impact of higher economic complexity. 12 Physical capital has similar, albeit\nsmaller, effects. When a country has high levels of human and physical capital, the amplification\neffect (with economic complexity) on \noutput is even stronger. Qatar has \nbuilt a large capital stock with top-\nnotch infrastructure quality, but its \nlabor productivity and economic \ncomplexity have substantial room to \nimprove.

AI in Qatar: Opportunities and Potential Economic Impact1 \nQatar has been actively preparing for embracing AI. In 2019, Qatar released its first National AI Strategy, \nfocusing on education, data access, employment, business, research, and ethics. The AI Committee, \nestablished in 2021, coordinates efforts from ministries, universities, and financial institutions. A $2.5 billion \nAI investment package was announced in May 2024. AI-related research has also surged. Overall, Qatar is \nclose to AEs in its AI readiness (text chart).  \nIncreasing AI adoption in Qatar is expected to bring more benefits than risks to the labor market. \nCurrently, about 37 percent of the labor force in Qatar is exposed to AI (18 ppts increase over a decade), \ncomparable to the EM average but lower than the AE average (58 percent). Building on IMF (2023)2 staff \nanalysis suggests that about 75 percent of the high AI exposure jobs in Qatar have high \n“complementarity”—workers in those jobs are more likely to benefit from AI-driven productivity gains than \nbeing replaced. Qatar’s labor market opportunity-to-risk ratio from AI exposure is significantly higher than \nEM or AE averages.  \n \n \nSources: IMF staff calculations. \n \nCraft and related \ntrades workers\nProfessionals\nElementary \noccupations\nPlant and machine \noperators\nServices and sales \nworkers\nTechnicians\nClerks\nManagers\nSkilled agricultural \nworkers\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n-0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\nExposure\nComplementarity\n2023\n2014\nAI Exposure and Complemetarity by Occupation, 2023\n(Higher value = higher exposure/complementarity)\n", "blocks": [[73.44000244140625, 34.293121337890625, 104.7734375, 52.34016036987305, "QATAR \n", 0, 0], [73.44000244140625, 741.3179931640625, 241.0290069580078, 756.8790283203125, "26 \nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND \n", 1, 0], [182.0399932861328, 73.05313110351562, 432.7545471191406, 103.79135131835938, "Text Figure 21.

Recent indicators suggest that the post-World Cup growth normalization has\nbottomed out and the gradual rebound in economic activities is gaining momentum.

{"page_number": 46, "text": "QATAR \n42 \nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND \n \nAnnex I. Overview of Qatar’s Third National Development Strategy \nThis Annex provides a brief overview of the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3), which sets \nthe priorities to build a knowledge-based and more sustainable economy. It stresses the state’s role as \nan enabler of private sector-led growth, based on a candid assessment of the limitations and \nchallenges associated with a state-driven growth model. \n1. \nQatar’s Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) aims for a transformation \ntoward a private sector-led, knowledge-based, and more sustainable economy (Annex Figure \n1-1). Issued in January 2024, NDS3 covers the last miles of Qatar’s National Vision (QNV) 2030. From \nNDS1 (2011-16), NDS2 (2018-22) to NDS3 (2024-30), Qatar’s diversification strategy has gradually \ntransitioned from a public sector-driven, infrastructure-focused approach, to one that empowers the \nprivate sector to build a more dynamic and innovative economy (Table 1). NDS3 aims to leverage \nQatar’s strengths built over the last decade, including large financial resources, enhanced human \ncapital, and high-quality infrastructure. The strategy lays out a systematic approach for economic \ntransformation, with ambitious targets set.  \n2. \nNDS3 highlights Qatar’s progress made since the launch of the Qatar National Vision \n2030. Substantial strides have been made in economic, human, social, environmental, and \ninstitutional development. In particular, Qatar has achieved solid economic growth during 2008–23 \n(average 5½ percent), with the share of non-hydrocarbon economy rising by more than 10 \npercentage points (ppts) to 63 ppts. Qatar’s education and health systems, labor market including \nfor expatriate workers, and government effectiveness have also witnessed significant improvements.  \n3. \nNDS3 also recognizes candidly the limitations and key challenges in Qatar’s \ndiversification journey. Qatar’s progress in economic diversification lags some other GCC \ncountries, especially in fiscal revenue and exports. NDS3 acknowledges relatively low non-\nhydrocarbon output growth in recent years with declining labor productivity, its costly diversification \nmodel driven largely by public sector spending with implications for fiscal sustainability, and \nincentives that hinder private sector development, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Skilled and \nhighly skilled employment rose (including both nationals and expatriates) but the majority remains \nless skilled. NDS3 points out barriers to market entry and FDI, various regulatory impediments, an \nimmature innovation ecosystem, and insufficient human capital as key challenges for further \ntransformation. The global energy transition only compounds the need to accelerate economic \ndiversification.  \n4. \nNDS3 stresses that the state should become an “enabler” of more vibrant and \nsustainable private sector-driven growth. A wide range of reforms are envisaged to close \nremaining gaps in innovation, human capital, and the regulatory environment. NDS3 highlights the \nneed to harmonize economic zones to help attract FDI, boost international trade including through \nadditional trade agreements with key target markets, and Public-Private partnership (PPP) to \nfacilitate private sector participation. It also identifies “diversification clusters” to build comparative \nadvantages, setting ambitious targets both at the sectoral level and on macroeconomic outcomes.  \n", "blocks": [[73.44000244140625, 34.293121337890625, 104.7734375, 52.34016036987305, "QATAR \n", 0, 0], [73.44000244140625, 741.3179931640625, 241.0290069580078, 756.8790283203125, "42 \nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND \n", 1, 0], [73.44000244140625, 70.29312133789062, 548.3400268554688, 105.46499633789062, " \nAnnex I.

NDS3 points out barriers to market entry and FDI, various regulatory impediments, an \nimmature innovation ecosystem, and insufficient human capital as key challenges for further \ntransformation. The global energy transition only compounds the need to accelerate economic \ndiversification.  \n", 6, 0], [73.42941284179688, 610.1758422851562, 534.0079345703125, 718.194091796875, "4. \nNDS3 stresses that the state should become an “enabler” of more vibrant and \nsustainable private sector-driven growth. A wide range of reforms are envisaged to close \nremaining gaps in innovation, human capital, and the regulatory environment.

External Sector Assessment \nOverall Assessment: Qatar’s external position moderated in 2023 and was assessed to be moderately \nstronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Tourism remained \nrobust and fiscal prudence was maintained, but hydrocarbon prices normalized and exports declined. In \n2024H1, tourism continued to be strong, but hydrocarbon export volume remained weaker than historical \nlevels, capping the current account surplus. In the medium term, hydrocarbon prices are projected to \nprogressively decline but export volume is set to increase owing to a significant ramp up in LNG production in \nthe pipeline. As domestic demand recovers, imports are expected to strengthen. On balance, the current \naccount gap is expected to continue narrowing. \nPotential Policy Responses: Structural reforms to enhance productivity and competitiveness, as envisaged \nunder NDS3 and the QNV 2030, would help raise private investment and reduce the saving-investment gap. \nFiscal prudence should be preserved, revenue diversification toward non-hydrocarbon sources accelerated, and \nspending reoriented to support the reform agenda. These factors will reduce the current gap and help align the \nexternal position in the medium term.  \nForeign Assets and Liabilities: Position and Trajectory \nBackground1. Central bank reserve accumulation was modest as the current account surplus narrowed and \nlarge asset acquisition abroad continued, including by the sovereign wealth fund (QIA). On the liabilities \nside, external debt declined somewhat in nominal terms due mainly to repayment of government debt but \nrose from 116 percent of GDP in 2022 to 123 percent of GDP in 2023 as nominal GDP shrank more. Central \nbank reserves stood at US$53.8 billion in November 2024, up US$2 billion from 2023.  \nAssessment. On the asset side, QCB’s foreign reserves and sizeable QIA foreign assets together are \nestimated to have exceeded 200 percent of GDP in 2023—they will continue to be supported by the \nprojected current account surpluses over the medium term. On the liabilities side, a moderate level of \nexternal public debt contributes to strong overall fiscal debt sustainability (Annex IV. Fiscal and Debt \nSustainability Assessment).

Nowcasting of Non-hydrocarbon GDP Growth in Qatar \nThis Annex applies nowcasting, which has been widely used for near-term growth projections, to \nQatar’s real non-hydrocarbon output growth, with several innovations. Results fit historical data well \nand point to a gradual recovery from the post-World Cup growth trough. A few caveats related to the \nmachine-learning approach for nowcasting are also discussed.  \n1. \nNowcasting generates real-time forecasts for key economic indicators where the \nofficial data may be unavailable or delayed by analyzing high-frequency macroeconomic \nindicators. For example, Qatar publishes GDP data with a lag of around 2-3 quarters, while policy \nmakers and businesses may need a more timely \nassessment of the economy to inform policy and \nbusiness decisions—nowcasting is an effective \ntool to fill the gap. This technique is particularly \nsuitable where high-frequency indicators are \nabundant and published timely, as in the case of \nQatar. Nowcasting models are also highly \nadaptable—they can be updated regularly with \nnew data, ensuring that the estimates remain \nrelevant and accurate amidst changing \neconomic conditions. \n \n2. \nA nowcasting model for Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon economy is developed, based on \nprevious IMF work (Barhoumi, Karim, et al. 2022, Akbal, Faruk, et al. 2023), following the steps \nbelow: \n• \nSelect predictive variables. A wide range of economic and financial indicators are selected to \ncapture domestic, regional and global conditions that could affect Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon \neconomy. These variables are chosen based on criteria such as predictive power (i.e., suggested \nby the pairwise correlation between the predictive variable and Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP), \ndata availability, and minimal lag time. A balance is maintained between the number of \npredictors and the size of the training data (used to fit nowcasting models with historical trends) \nto avoid overfitting – a situation where the model is too \"tailored\" to the training data and fails \nto generalize to other situations, leading to inaccurate predictions. \n \n• \nSelect nowcasting models. The selected time series data are processed through advanced \nmachine learning algorithms (see below). A variety of models, including Support Vector \nMachines (SVMs), Random Forests, and Elastic Net, are trained by historical data. Each model's \nperformance is evaluated using a range of metrics (e.g., out-of-sample root-mean-squared error \n(RMSE)), and the best-performing models are selected for further analysis. \n \n• \nIdentify contributions of predictive variables. Shapley decomposition is applied to break \ndown the contribution of each variable to the nowcast results. This method allows us to pinpoint \nFigure III.1.

For example, Qatar publishes GDP data with a lag of around 2-3 quarters, while policy \nmakers and businesses may need a more timely \nassessment of the economy to inform policy and \nbusiness decisions—nowcasting is an effective \ntool to fill the gap. This technique is particularly \nsuitable where high-frequency indicators are \nabundant and published timely, as in the case of \nQatar. Nowcasting models are also highly \nadaptable—they can be updated regularly with \nnew data, ensuring that the estimates remain \nrelevant and accurate amidst changing \neconomic conditions. \n \n2. \nA nowcasting model for Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon economy is developed, based on \nprevious IMF work (Barhoumi, Karim, et al. 2022, Akbal, Faruk, et al. 2023), following the steps \nbelow: \n", 4, 0], [73.44003295898438, 445.2027587890625, 540.1528930664062, 703.1729736328125, "• \nSelect predictive variables. A wide range of economic and financial indicators are selected to \ncapture domestic, regional and global conditions that could affect Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon \neconomy. These variables are chosen based on criteria such as predictive power (i.e., suggested \nby the pairwise correlation between the predictive variable and Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP), \ndata availability, and minimal lag time. A balance is maintained between the number of \npredictors and the size of the training data (used to fit nowcasting models with historical trends) \nto avoid overfitting – a situation where the model is too \"tailored\" to the training data and fails \nto generalize to other situations, leading to inaccurate predictions. \n \n• \nSelect nowcasting models. The selected time series data are processed through advanced \nmachine learning algorithms (see below). A variety of models, including Support Vector \nMachines (SVMs), Random Forests, and Elastic Net, are trained by historical data.

Hydrocarbon prices are set to remain relatively high and commitmen\nto, and the recent track record of, fiscal discipline support low fiscal and debt risk. The large reserves of natural gas, cleaner than \nother browner fossil fuels, is likely to play a key role in a smoother energy transition, and strong financial buffers (including from the \nsovereign wealth fund, QIA) can provide support if downside risks materialize. The projected non-hydrocarbon primary balance \n(NHPB) is broadly consistent with the benchmark guided by the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) in the long term (see the main\ntext of the Staff Report). The authorities are in the process of producing own actuarial studies on the sustainability of the pension \nsystem.  \nSource: Fund staff. \nNote: The risk of sovereign stress is a broader concept than debt sustainability. Unsustainable debt can only be resolved through exceptional measures (such as debt \nrestructuring). In contrast, a sovereign can face stress without its debt necessarily being unsustainable, and there can be various measures—that do not involve a debt \nrestructuring—to remedy such a situation, such as fiscal adjustment and new financing. \n1/ The near-term assessment is not applicable in cases where there is a disbursing IMF arrangement. In surveillance-only cases or in cases with precautionary IMF \narrangements, the near-term assessment is performed but not published. \n2/ A debt sustainability assessment is optional for surveillance-only cases and mandatory in cases where there is a Fund arrangement. The mechanical signal of the debt \nsustainability assessment is deleted before publication.

Higher-than-projected energy prices could \nstrengthen fiscal and external positions, and non-\nhydrocarbon output growth as ample hydrocarbon \nliquidity and positive private sector confidence \ncould boost consumption and investment. Pressures \nto increase public spending could rise. Lower oil \nprices would weaken the external and fiscal \nbalances, and growth. \nThe authorities should implement a medium-\nterm fiscal framework which helps insulate \npublic spending from oil price volatility. \nDiversifying the revenue base toward more \nnon-hydrocarbon sources would reduce \nrevenue sensitivity to energy price volatility. \nAccelerate structural reforms to advance \neconomic diversification. \nMedium \nMedium \n \nGlobal growth downside surprise. Growth \nslowdown in major economies, including \ndue to supply disruptions, tight monetary \npolicy, rising corporate bankruptcies, or a \ndeeper-than-envisaged real estate sector \ncontraction, with adverse spillovers through \ntrade and financial channels, triggering \nsudden stops in some EMDEs. (Low \nprobability is assigned to surprise \nacceleration in global growth).  \nLower external demand reduces hydrocarbon export \nprices, weakening fiscal and external positions which \nare currently strong. Slower global growth would \nalso weigh on domestic growth, affecting banking \nsector asset quality. Global financial market \ncorrections may lead to capital outflows and \nincrease financial stability risks, including due to \nbanks’ still sizeable exposure to foreign funding.  \nQatar has fiscal space to respond to a major \ngrowth slowdown. Fiscal policy should be \nanchored in a medium-term framework to \nreduce the risk of procyclicality. Continue to \nclosely monitor banking sector developments \nto maintain financial stability. Accelerate \nstructural reforms to boost economic \ndiversification and non-hydrocarbon \npotential output.  \nMedium \nLow \n \nMonetary policy calibration. Amid \nelevated uncertainty and data surprises, \nmonetary policy stances in major countries \nturn out to be too loose, hindering \ndisinflation, or too tight for too long than \nwarranted, stifling growth domestically and \nglobally, and increasing capital flow and \nexchange rate volatility in EMDEs. \nConsistent with the exchange rate peg, monetary \npolicy in Qatar would closely follow that of the U.S. \nAs domestic inflationary pressure remains low and \ngrowth continues to normalize from the World Cup-\ndriven boom, the risk that a too loose monetary \nstance could de-anchor inflation expectations is \nlimited. On the other hand, a monetary stance too \ntight for too long than warranted could negatively \naffect demand, but the ongoing public investment \nand spillovers from the North Field LNG expansion \nwill support growth. \nMaintain monetary policy and liquidity \nmanagement that are consistent with the \ncurrency peg. Continue to closely monitor \nbanking sector developments to ensure \nfinancial stability. If growth is negatively \naffected by unduly tight (imported) monetary \npolicy stance, some fiscal space could be \ndeployed to provide targeted support while \nmaintaining broad fiscal prudence.  \nMedium \nLow \n \nSystemic financial instability. High interest \nrates and risk premia, and sudden asset \nrepricing amid economic slowdowns and \npolicy uncertainty (including from elections) \ntrigger market dislocations, with cross-\nborder spillovers and an adverse macro-\nfinancial feedback loop putting weak banks \nand NBFIs under pressure. \nTighter global financial conditions would increase \ndebt service and financing costs, and increase the \nliquidity risk for domestic banks reliant on foreign \nfunding as banks’ net foreign liabilities remain \nrelatively high. Such risks are however mitigated by \nQatar’s large financial buffers, favorable market \naccess, high sovereign credit ratings, and banks’ \nreduced exposure to nonresident deposits.   \nMaintain prudent financial sector policy and \nclosely monitor risks and vulnerabilities \nrelated to financial institutions, including \nthrough stress tests and thematic inspections. \nProvide liquidity to the financial system if \nneeded, compatible with the currency peg.  \n \n1  The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path.

Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance but with shortcomings. Data frequency, timeliness and coverage should be improved. \nNational accounts. Data sources used to compile quarterly estimates of GDP at current and constant prices need to be broadened to enhance accuracy. GDP by \nexpenditure needs to be more up to date–by component annual data lag the headline (in current prices) or are available only up to 2018 (in constant prices). For the latter, \nthe quarterly data should also provide a breakdown (only the headline number is produced). Timeliness was an issue also for GDP by activity data (2023Q4 GDP data were \nreleased in early-September 2024. 2024Q1–Q2 GDP data were released in early-December 2024 and 2024Q3 GDP data at end-December 2024).  \nPrices.

The authorities are implementing the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) which enables compilation of accrual fiscal \naccounts. An IMF Technical Assistance (TA) mission in 2019 supported transition to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014. Transparency was enhanced by the \npublication of annual budget documents and quarterly budget performance reports for the central government with headline budget and debt numbers––the reports \ncould include more line items and quarterly debt numbers. The prospectus for sovereign euro bond issuance includes detailed information on revenue and expenditure line \nitems, and external bonds, but publication is infrequent. For the 2023 budget, a press release was published and, instead of the regular budget statement, the Minister \nprovided relevant information at the press conference. The format of the 2024 budget statement was similar to the 2023 budget press release.

A 2017 TA mission helped develop a quarterly survey for nonfinancial sector data aimed at producing a quarterly \nInternational Investment Position (IIP) statement. However, following the TA the authorities have continued to face capacity constraints in providing comprehensive IIP data \nto the IMF. More work is needed to ensure comprehensive data coverage, collection, and granularity—efforts should strengthen to allow Qatar's participation in key \nsurveys like the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS).  \nMonetary and financial sectors. The QCB submits the monetary and financial statistics (MFS) for the central bank and other depository corporations based on the \nStandardized Report Forms (SRFs).
